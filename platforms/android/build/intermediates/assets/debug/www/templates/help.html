          <p style="text-align: justify;">If the person does have an existing account and the latest Username displayed is not the one, it is possible to see the list of all Users via the Other Users link (#5). Press on the Username (#3) displayed to log in.

          <h4 style="color:white; text-align: left;">HOME SCREEN</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The Home Screen comprises of all the different joints that can be measured. On the centre of the screen there is a human body (#1) in which all the different joints are marked with red dots. The users can press on these dots (#2) and the app will take them to the chosen joint screen, e.g. Elbow screen</p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The screen will also have a side menu (#3) on the top left hand side of the screen that shows the Manage User tab (#4), Reports button (#5) to view all the results, About (#6) and Help (#7). 
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 style="color:white; text-align: left;">MEASURING</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The measuring screen page is accessed by pressing any of the joints (red dots) on the home screen. The user will have an optional tutorial video (#1) to watch and learn the right placement of the device and technique of measuring each joint. Under the video, there is a drop-down menu (#2) that list all different ROM measurements to choose between for each specific joint. There is also a Start/S (#3) button and a degree reader under the drop-down menu. The Start button (#3) is initially green which switches to red Stop button (#4) as measuring is in progress.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The app accesses the devices’ Gyroscope and Compass censors to perform the measurements. As these censors are very sensitive, it is recommended to have slow movements while measuring to increase the accuracy. Moreover, the Compass function works better when the device’s Location Services are turned on.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">On the bottom, left hand side of the Start/Stop button, there is a button called Add to Report (#5) which adds the result to the report file once the measuring stops. After results are added, next step is to press the View Report (#6) button located at the bottom, right hand side of the screen that shows the full result page.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The results can be accessed in two ways, the first option is directly after measuring and the second option is from the Main Menu by clicking on Reports. In each case, there is Export (#7) button on the top, right corner of the screen that allows to send the reports via email. Moreover, all results are stored within the app so they can be accessed at any point of time.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The report can be exported either in PDF or EXCEL file format. As the App will be using email to send the report, it is recommended to have email set up via the device’s email application.
